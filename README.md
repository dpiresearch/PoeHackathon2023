# Video Discovery

## Overview

This code is mostly the quick start code from POE, modified for the hackathon.  The use case is a bot that
answers questions about a particular domain ( in this case California DMV rules ) and also finds snippets
of video showing the related situation from TwelveLabs.  

## Requrements

Server subscription and startup from Modal, then you can use the bot at https://poe.com/Poe_AutoBot.  See the quick start guide below.

## Current issues/Caveats

TwelveLabs can give you video snippets if you do a search using their UI, but at the moment, their API
only gives you a jpg thumbnail.  Future iterations should have a url to a video snippet instead.
